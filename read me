# 🧠 AWS MLOps — Diabetes Prediction

A simple demo showing **end-to-end MLOps on AWS** using **S3, SageMaker, and Gradio**.  
The project trains a model, uploads it to S3, deploys it as an endpoint, and provides a web UI for predictions.

---

## ⚙️ Steps

### 1️⃣ Train & Upload Model
```bash
python train_upload_model.py
````

Trains a Linear Regression model and uploads it to your S3 bucket.

### 2️⃣ Deploy to SageMaker

```bash
python deploy_model.py
```

Deploys the model as a SageMaker endpoint.

### 3️⃣ Test Locally

Use Gradio for easy predictions:

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

---


## 🧩 Tools

* Python + scikit-learn
* AWS S3 + SageMaker
* Boto3 + Gradio
* dotenv for security

Would you like me to also give you the `.gitignore` file (so `.env` and model files don’t upload)?
